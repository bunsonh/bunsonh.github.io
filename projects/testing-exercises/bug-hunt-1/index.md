### Notes

Bug Hunt #1 - Academy Bugs
*Manual Testing*

25 of 25 bugs completed.
21 of 25 bugs found organically.
4 of 25 bugs found via Reddit and YouTube.

In the 'Find Bugs' exercises, I managed to find 21 / 25 bugs organically. The remaining 4 I turned to user comments on Reddit and YouTube. I treated these as "user submitted" bugs. My failure to find the remainder was due my hesitation to create a login. It would have been better if the site had offered dummy logins or allowed a user to create a login without authentication. If this had been communicated in a note of some sort, I would have had a much easier time with the remaining bugs.

I opted to create "bug reports" as individual .md files. Even using a template, this proved tedious. Next I will see how the GitHub issues tool works. I would like to avoid Jira for these exercises because, despite the industry standard, it's not possible to reveal the bugs publiclly, nor to a general person with their own Jira account.
