<h3 id="why-ive-used-chatgpt">Why I’ve used ChatGPT</h3>

<p>In addition to drawing from my professional experience, I’ve employed ChatGPT and other LLMs to guide areas of this project. I’ve debated its value throughout which has lead to many questions and insights.</p>

<p>For starters, here are a few places where I’ve used these tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explored best practice and setup assistance for local dev environment, selecting IDE, system configuration</li>
  <li>Assistance with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> integration, generating/importing SSH key</li>
  <li>Configuring Jekyll server, selecting and importing theme for this project</li>
  <li>Problem solving or assistance with finding the shortest path to a solution</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the process, I’ve debated what using ChatGPT has represented with this project. I’ve come to see it as a blend of these factors.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Customized, purpose-made documentation</span>. By querying the specific problem I’m attempting to solve, I am provided with a document that is akin to documentation catered specifically to the use case. As there is also a log, I can quickly retrieve previous information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">As a mentor</span>. Along with specific info in the above documentation example, I am also offered detailed explanations of the issue, with the ability to cross-reference with context how it may relate to the larger solution. This can be queried for further explanation to grow my understanding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">A “crutch</span>.” If I need a quick solution where I am unconcerned with the context, I can query for a short answer, or skip over the details to efficiently solve the problem. There is a risk here in not building a deeper understanding, but when balanced against the previous functions, I believe this to be an effective use of the tool.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the professional team setting, I would expect this combination to be a way to effectively ramp-up new hires and reduce friction and time constraints between teammates in need of general mentoring. Domain-specific mentorship would still be necessary, but for generalized questions, it would be extremely helpful.</p>
